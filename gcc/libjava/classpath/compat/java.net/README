This directory contains various "experiment" programs used to determine
the behavior of the java.net class where such behavior is not sufficiently
documented by Sun in order to write an implementation from docs alone.

Some key findings:

The setOption/getOption methods are discussed in the "Networking Enhancements"
document for Java 1.1 but are not in the javadocs.  However, the SocketImpl
class is shown implementing a SocketOptions interface that is not documented.
We assume this is a non-public interface which contains abstract declarations
of the get/setOption methods as well as contants for the option_id's.

TCP_NODELAY:
  The option id of this option is 1.  The Object passed to setOption is
  a Boolean indicating whether this option should be on (true) or off (false).

SO_LINGER:
  The option id of this option is 128.  When SO_LINGER is to be disabled,
  the Object passed to setOption is Boolean with a value of false.  When
  SO_LINGER is to be enabled, the Object passed to setOption is an Integer
  set to the linger value.

SO_TIMEOUT:
  The option id of this option is 4102.  The Object passed to setOption is
  an Integer that is the new timeout value (0 to disable).
