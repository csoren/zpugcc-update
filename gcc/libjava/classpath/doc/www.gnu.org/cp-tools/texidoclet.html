<a name="Introduction"></a> <h2>1. Introduction</h2> 

<h3><a name="whatis"></a>What is GNU TexiDoclet?</h3>

GNU TexiDoclet is a system for creating <b>info</b> pages from Java
source documentation. It is part of the <a
href="/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath</a> project, however it can
also be used as standalone doclet used with any Java-compatible
platform.

<p>You can use TexiDoclet to create API documentation in <b>info</b>
format for any set of Java packages (including classpath). The latter
will reproduce the full Java API documentation for use on text-only
displays, or for integrating it into the GNU Emacs online help
facility.  </p><p>TexiDoclet also includes an Elisp package which adds
context-sensitive help features to GNU Emacs. 
</p>

<table bgcolor="#cccccc" border="0" cols="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Note:</b> This is alpha software. You should not use
      TexiDoclet in a production environment, because it has not yet
      been tested for reliability. Also, see <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>
      for a list of currently missing
      features.</td></tr></tbody></table> <h3><a name="whyuse"></a>Why
      use the <b>info</b> format?</h3>Although the <b>info</b> format
      is raw text with nearly no formatting or highlighting, using the
      <b>info</b> version of the Java API documentation can have a
      number of advantages even on graphical displays - especially if
      you are using GNU Emacs:

<ul>
  <li>Because it is text-only, <b>info</b> is pretty fast. 
  </li><li>You can easily navigate through <b>info</b> pages using only the keyboard 
  - which doesn't hold true for most HTML browsers available today, where you 
  always have to grab the mouse or tab the focus. 
  </li><li>You can use all the powerful Emacs facilities to browse the documentation 
  (e.g. incremental search, regular expressions, bookmarks). 
  </li><li>You can copy documentation fragments (like the definition of a method you 
  want to overload) easily using the keyboard, again having all Emacs facilities 
  right at hand, such as the ring buffer. 
  </li><li>You have no frames in <b>info</b>, but you can use the Speedbar contained 
  in recent Emacs distributions for the same purpose [not tested as yet].
  </li></ul>

<h3><a name="howstart"></a>How do I get started?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Check the <a href="#Requirements">Requirements</a> 
  section and download/install any missing tools. 
  </li><li><a href="#Download">Download</a> 
  and <a href="#Installation">unpack</a> 
  the TexiDoclet package. 
  </li><li>See section <a href="#configure">Configure</a> 
  for further instructions. </li></ul>

<h3>Thanks!</h3>
<p>TexiDoclet was originally written as a standalone doclet by <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org/users/julian/">Julian Scheid</a> and was
contributed to the GNU Project as part of GNU Classpath.</a>
</p>


<hr>

<a name="Requirements"></a>

<h2>2. Requirements</h2>In order to use TexiDoclet, you need the
following software installed:

<ul>
  <li>A Java platform 1.2 or better. The intention is to be able have
  TexiDoclet work first and foremost with <a
  href="/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath</a> and other completely
  free toolchains (<em>with <a href="gjdoc.en.html">gjdoc</a> we are
  99% there!</em>) although it can be used with non-free VMs.</li>

  <li>GNU Make and GNU makeinfo. Note: makeinfo is contained in the GNU
  texinfo package. </li>

  <li>A Unix environment: 
  <ul>
    <li><tt>bash</tt> and the standard commands like <tt>cp</tt> are essential 
    </li><li><tt>which</tt> and <tt>awk</tt> are required for checking the setup 
    </li><li><tt>gzip</tt> is used to compress the <b>info</b> pages. </li>
  </ul>
  
<!--
  </li><li>The Java Community source code, if you want to reproduce
  documentation for the Java core API. <strong>Note: this is
  <em>not</em> distributed with TexiDoclet because it is released
  under a non-free software license, the SCSL, which is incompatible
  with the GNU GPL.  If you wish to create the Java API documentation
  you must download and agree to it's terms (we cannot do
  this).</strong></li>
-->

  </ul>

  Makeinfo is required to convert the texinfo source into the
  <b>info</b> format. If you only need the texinfo source, you don't
  need makeinfo. Unix users will probably find a makeinfo preinstalled
  on their system.  Windows users can find free precompiled binaries
  on the Internet (look for the Texinfo package). <br> 

<table bgcolor="#cccccc" border="0" cols="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Note:</b> There are some 16-bit makeinfo binaries available online, 
      but they won't work. You need to look for an up-to-date 32-bit 
  binary.</td></tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>GNU Make is required because if you want to generate the full
standard Java API documentation, each package must be processed
individually. The Makefile works with patterns to process the packages
individually and merge the results.</p>

<p>Again, Unix users will find Make preinstalled. Windows users can
find precompiled binaries on the Internet for free. <br> 
</p>

<table bgcolor="#cccccc" border="0" cols="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
      <td><b>Note:</b> Use only GNU Make - you will probably get into
      trouble if you try to use a different Make tool, because the
      TexiDoclet Makefile uses some GNU-specific
      features.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
</table>

<!--
<p>You need the Java community source code if you want to reproduce the full 
core API documentation. Get it from <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/">Sun's Java Developer Website</a>. Having 
the source at hand is generally recommended. <br>  
</p>
-->

      that all utilities (including the Java tools) are on your system search

<h3>3.1 Tool download locations for Windows users [untested]</h3>

<p>Although the present version of TexiDoclet has not been tested on
Windows, a previous incarnation was working using the following:
Windows 98 / Sun JDK 1.3 RC2 / Cygwin B-20 (GNU bash 2.02.1) / GNU
Make 3.78.1 / GNU makeinfo 1.68 (GNU texinfo 3.12) / GNU Emacs
20.6.1</p>

<p>Here are a few URLs for getting the Windows ports of the required
software:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">The Cygwin project</a> offers the most
    sophisticated port of Unix utilities for free download. Their "full" package 
    includes a Bash and a full-featured Unix environment (including <tt>grep</tt>, <tt>less</tt>, <tt>awk</tt> and other 
    useful commands.) With regard to TexiDoclet, only GNU <tt>make</tt> and <tt>makeinfo</tt> 
    are missing.

</li><li><a href="http://www.tertius.com/projects/library/#cygwin32">tertius.com</a> contains a 
    link to a Windows port of the texinfo package, 
    including the required <tt>makeinfo</tt> tool. It also includes a standalone <b>info</b> viewer.

</li>

<li>Refer to the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU Make
homepage</a> and to <a
href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/">http://ftp.gnu.org</a> for
downloading the GNU Make binaries for Windows.  </li></ul>

<a name="Download"></a>

<a name="Download">
<h2>3. Download</a></h2>

The old (pre-GNU) version of TexiDoclet is still located at our old
development site on sourceforge and is available from <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7984">SourceForge</a>.
This (old) 0.5 version is provided purely as a convenience, and will
soon be replaced by a new version .  Subsequent releases will be made
available at via the GNU ftp site (<a
href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/">http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/).</a>

<p>The package includes an autoconfiguration system, the full source
code, and additional Emacs add-ons.  It unpacks into a separate
directory named "<tt>texidoclet-(version)</tt>".  </p>

<p>If you want to take a look at TexiDoclet's output first, here is a
<a
href="http://texidoclet.sf.net/texidoclet-api-info-0.5.tar.gz">sample
(32 K gzipped tar)</a>.  It's the converted `info' docs for the
TexiDoclet API (please note that the package name
<tt>gnu.texidoclet</tt> is now obsoleted by
<tt>gnu.classpath.tools.doclets.texidoclet</tt>) itself.  [To view run
the standalone <tt>info</tt> viewer: <tt>info -f
texidoclet.info</tt>.]

<h2>4. Installation</h2>


<p><strong>Please note the following instructions relate purely to the
old 0.5 version of GNU texidoclet, which is currently the only
release</strong></p>

<p>In order to install TexiDoclet, you should unpack it to a location
of your choice. TexiDoclet will unpack into a separate subdirectory,
which contains the following files and directories:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>Makefile </tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>the TexiDoclet main Makefile.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>COPYING </tt></td>
    <td> </td>
    <td>the GNU public license (Version 2)</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>etc/ </tt></td> <td></td> 

    <td>contains Makefile template for generating the docs for Sun's
    code.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>lisp/ </tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>contains add-ons for enabling context-sensitive help in Emacs.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>source/ </tt></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>contains the full Java source code for TexiDoclet</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>After you have unpacked the archive, you should configure TexiDoclet as 
described in the following section, <a href="#configure">Configure</a>.</p>

<hr>

<a name="configure"></a>

<h2>6. Configure</h2>

<p><strong>Please note the following instructions relate purely to the
old 0.5 version of GNU texidoclet, which is currently the only
release</strong></p>

[Taken from the <tt>README</tt> file in the distribution]

<pre>
Installation:
============

1. The usual GNU autoconf procedure applies: 

   ./configure
   make

   Read the generic INSTALL file for the details.

2. Extra texidoclet-specific options for `configure':

   `--with-jdkdir=DIR'      

    DIR specifies the location of the JDK (if it's not on the PATH)

   `--with-javadocjar=FILE'  

   Use FILE as jar file with javadoc support.  

3. This will generate the jar file in source/TexiDoclet.jar.  You can
   choose to run "make install" at this point, although this is not,
   strictly speaking, necessary.

4.  To see an example of the invocation of TexiDoclet, type "make
    check".  This will build the `info' docs for texidoclet itself in
    the "source" subdirectory.

<a name="Usage"></a>

<h2>8. Usage</h2>

<p><strong>Please note the following instructions relate purely to the
old 0.5 version of GNU texidoclet, which is currently the only
release</strong></p>

[Taken from the <tt>README</tt> file in the distribution]

<pre>
Usage:
=====

1.  TexiDoclet now works like any other doclet [Consult
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/ for further information on
    Javadoc and the Javadoc API], it can be invoked with default
    options by merely supplying the path the doclet and the doclet
    invocation class (which is `gnu.texidoclet.Driver'):

javadoc -docletpath TexiDoclet.jar -doclet gnu.texidoclet.Driver &lt;filename&gt; ...

2.  It also accepts all the Standard Sun doclet options, in addition
    to some TexiDoclet-specific ones, which are listed if you invoke
    javadoc without any Java source files or packages.  Here are those
    options:

-d &lt;directory&gt;            Destination directory for output files
-tocbase         &lt;base&gt;   Prefix for all package-level texi files (default 'packages'
-indexbase       &lt;base&gt;   Prefix for package index
-allclassesbase  &lt;base&gt;   Prefix for all class list
-treebase        &lt;base&gt;   Prefix for tree output
-etagsname       &lt;base&gt;   Prefix for package etags
-tocheader       &lt;text&gt;   Header for each texi file
-tocfooter       &lt;text&gt;   Footer for each texi file
-copyrightnotice &lt;text&gt;   Copyright information on each texi page
-wordwrappos     &lt;chars&gt;  Number of columns at which to wrap
-firstlineindent &lt;chars&gt;  Number of columns to indent
-includeauthor            Include author information?
-fulltreealignment &lt;type&gt; 'replace' or null
-heritagealignment &lt;type&gt; 'replace' or null

    Most of these options are self-explanatory and all have
    `reasonable' defaults, and are in the process of being more fully
    documented.

3.  To generate the `info' documentation, invoke `makeinfo' on the
    resultant `.texi' file.  See the documentation accompanying your
    texinfo installation for more details.  [Note you can use texinfo
    to also generate printed and HTML documentation from the `.texi'
    files, but note that there are more specialised doclets for that
    purpose].

<h2>7. Bugs</h2>

<p><strong>Please note the following instructions relate purely to the
old 0.5 version of GNU texidoclet, which is currently the only
release</strong></p>

[Taken from <tt>BUGS</tt> in the distribution]

<pre>Known Bugs, or "features not yet implemented", in roughly the order
they will be attacked. New versions of this software implementing all
or part of the missing features can be expected soon.

* No cross-links for parameter types, return types, and thrown exceptions. 

* No support for {@link}. 

* Not very configurable at the time. 

* Various small improvements on Info page layout pending. 

* Elisp scripts for context sensitive help are preliminary. (Can
  anyone help me out here? I am new to Lisp and would need some
  advice.)

* Autoconf support for the Cygnus environment (simply untested at the
  moment).</pre>

<hr>

<a name="Todo"></a>

<h2>9. TODO</h2>

[Taken from <tt>TODO</tt> in distribution]

<pre>
* Check bug list. 

* Improve source code documentation and this page.

* Check Speedbar compatibility.

* Look for a way to add a link to the corresponding Java source code
  into all Info nodes.

* Same for original HTML documentation (using browse-url)

* Perhaps integrate XML/XSL support when it becomes part of the Java
  standard. Currently, the user would have had to download a package
  of some MB and install it, if an XML library would have been
  employed for TexiDoclet.
