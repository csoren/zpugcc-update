<h1>A pure java implementation of the java.util.zip library</h1>

This project provides an implementation of the java.util.zip classes.
<br><br>
The code is pure java (no native code is used), and we aim to be compatible with existing java.util.zip implementations. Some code was borrowed from libgcj, almost all the rest was written by Jochen Hoenicke.
<br><br>
There is very similar project at <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/index.html">http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/index.html</a>.<br>
Another project to implement bzip2 is at <a href="http://www.aftexsw.com/aftex/products/java/bzip/">http://www.aftexsw.com/aftex/products/java/bzip/</a>.
<p>
For the latest source, see the classpath CVS repository. On this page you'll find source and binary releases of the code in both the <strong>net.sf.jazzlib</strong> and <strong>java.util.zip</strong> namespaces.
<p>
The <strong>net.sf.jazzlib</strong> namespace is useful for situations where native code isn't allowed (such as in applets) and you need to use zip files. Builds in the <strong>java.util.zip</strong> namespace have a -juz suffix.
