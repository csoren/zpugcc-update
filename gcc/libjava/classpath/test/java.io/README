This directory contains tests for the java.io package.  Some important
things to note:

-- The file dataoutput-jdk.out is the results of the DataInputOutputTest
   test run through the JDK.  It is needed for the real test so please
   don't delete it.

-- The directory filetest and its contents are used for the FileTest test.
   If that test bombs in the middle, it may leave the directory renamed
   to something else.  In that case, you will need to rename it back
   manually to re-run the test after making fixes.
